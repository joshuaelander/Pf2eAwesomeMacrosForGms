# Pf2eAwesomeMacrosForGms
Overview: A collection of very useful Foundry VTT macros for GMs to use in PF2e. I often found myself needing things mid-session so I decided to make them myself. Here are 10 ones I found useful.

Contents: \
1.) Apply Initiative Modifier - Updates players initiatives easily after start of encounter	\
2.) Award Xp - Award selected or all players xp	\
3.) Easy Add Conditions  - Add conditions to selected or all players	\
4.) Easy Exploration - Add exploration activites to selected player and post to chat \
5.) Full Restore - Restore hp to full and heal certain conditions related to resting or healing \
6.) Journal to HTML Export - Export a copy of the journal to help the GM to study before sessions \
7.) Quick Combat Cleanup - Remove dead creatures bodies after combat and end the encounter. \
8.) Quick Recall Knowledge - Do a full party recall knowledge to help speed up when multiple people want to check \
9.) Quick Token Resizer - Quickly resize token to big or small to help with space in dungeons \
10.) Random Encounter Generator - Generate a random encounter from the bestiary or monster core of PF2e
